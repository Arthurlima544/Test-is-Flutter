# Tests-in-Flutter

This project is a base for all tests in that exist in flutter.

Creating a simple view for infinite list with ValueNotifier to state Management.

There will exist a listTile that will be a component and tested out in widgets, like soo , the widget can be reuse in other part of the application without breaking anything.

The infinite list will be tested out in a integration test (end to end) to verify its proper functioning.

To organize the criation of this app, i'll use Github issues to help.
